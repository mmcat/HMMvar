Major parts:

1. Search for homologous sequences of query protein sequence (psiblast)

classes involved: search (blast search, blast output file parser), variant (features: sequence, variants,etc), sequence (features: sequence,etc;functions:searchHomo),etc.

2. Multiple sequences alignments (Muscle)

classes involved: seqAlign,

3. Scoring (HMMER3)

classes involved: scoreVariant 

4. Drivering

file involved: HmmVar.cpp
